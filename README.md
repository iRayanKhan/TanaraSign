# TanaraSign


A multiplatform app for all Apple Platforms written in 100% SwiftUI.
These apps have 0 UIKit, 0 AppKit, 0 WatchKit. 



#Known Issues:
- When sideloaded, deeplinks may not work (install=, pairTV=)
- When trying to edit a paired AppleTV, you may have to add a second dummy AppleTV to fetch data from first AppleTV
- Watch app may not recieve sync data
- TV app may not recieve sync data (You can manuall fix this by going to http://AppleTVIP:9992/hello/b64StringOfRepoUrls)

These issues will be resolved in a future update to ensure 100% consistency.
